# BeMe (Bèvar Mèjo)

BevarMejo is a monolithic repository containing all the code and documentation developed during my Ph.D. journey focused on water distribution system optimisation.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of two main components:

- **bemelib**: A C++17 library for optimisation of water distribution systems, built around the pagmo optimisation framework for highly parallel computing and the EPANET project for hydraulic simulation
- **pybeme**: A Python 3.12 library providing utilities for visualisation and analysis of bemelib optimisation results

## Related Resources

All research outputs, presentations, and supplementary materials that can be shared are available open-access on Zenodo: [Zanutto, 2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10912466).

## Getting Started

- **Project maintenance**: See the [Versioning](versioning.md) page to understand how the project is maintained and released
- **Setup instructions**: Follow the [Installation Guide](building.md) to build and use bemelib and pybeme

## About

This work is part of a Ph.D. project on water distribution system optimisation, conducted through a collaboration between Politecnico di Milano and KWR Water Research Institute.

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the ERC Synergy Grant Water-Futures (Grant agreement No.951424).

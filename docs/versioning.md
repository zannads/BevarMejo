Versions follow this convention:
`vyy.mm.x` 
- `v` for version
- `yy` for end of the year 
- `mm` for  the month of the year
- `x` for the release of the month

The current version is hard-coded in the library, specifically in the `CMakeLists.txt` main file. 

An additional suffix with the name of the conference or event for which the code is being released can be present with the format `-<conference-name-YYYY>`.

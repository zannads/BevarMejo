# BevarMejo
Bevar Mejo is the monolithic repository containing all the code and documentation developed during my Ph.D. journey. Every result, presentation, text- that can be shared- is also open-acess and acessible on Zenodo (Zanutto, 2022)[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10912467]. 
For more information about me, see https://zannads.github.io.
For the code documentation, visit the [GitHub pages of this project](https://zannads.github.io/BevarMejo/).

##Â Versioning
The versioning of my repositories (data and code) follows this convention: `vyy.mm.x<-optional-event-name-YYYY>`. 
Following the recent trend of many open source projects the versioning follows the year.month.number convention. The optional string containing the event name is to reference specific events like conferences or paper pubblications that I submitted.

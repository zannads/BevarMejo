# BevarMejo
Bevar Mejo is the monolithic repository containing all the code and documentation developed during my Ph.D. journey. Every result, presentation, text- that can be shared- is also open-acess and acessible on Zenodo [Zanutto, 2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10912467). 

For more information about me, see https://zannads.github.io.

For the code documentation, visit the [GitHub pages of this project](https://zannads.github.io/BevarMejo/).
